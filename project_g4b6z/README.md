## User Stories

A *user stories* list:
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple tasks to my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of tasks on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as complete on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a task from my to-do-list
- As a user, I want to be able to see the number of incomplete and number of completed tasks on my to-do list


- As a user, I want to be able to save my to-do list to file

## Phase4 Task2 (SameTaskException and todolist.add())
- Test and design a class in model package that is robust.
must have at least one method that throws a checked exception.
must have one test for the case where the exception is expected and another where the exception is not expected.

##Phase4: Task3
-if I have more time, I will refactor RunApp.Because I think that class is a little
bit messy and coupling. I will separate that class. Also, I will refactor Task class,
use name and completed status as Map().
